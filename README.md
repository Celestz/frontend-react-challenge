## Requirements

### Must

* Use `React` (preferred `Next.js`)
* Use ES6+
* Write unit tests (any testing library, but preferred `jest`)
* Make it responsive / mobile friendly

### Optional

* Use a type system (preferred `Typescript` or `flow`)
* Write integration tests
* Use styled components (preferred `css modules` or `emotion`)
* Save form values to state or context

## Setup

As this test is to evaluate basic `React` skills, we are not be focusing on tooling setup (webpack, babel, etc...).

So feel free to use [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) or [create next app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to jump start your development, although if not comfortable custom setup is also welcomed.

## Description

We want to make multi step form. This form is aimed to help user order food from a restaurant. The wireframes are available [at this link] (https://www.figma.com/file/RsvCqxq86NkWDfW01G6gYa/Coding-Challenge?node-id=1%3A2) or in the wireframes folder.

Data is provided in the [data](./data) folder and images are provided in the [images](./images) folder. Fonts used are available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and any additional icons are available at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Step 1

* Users inputs the number of people (maximum 10)

### Step 2

* User adds dishes to their order
* Come up with a way to add items to the right person

### Step 3

* User is presented with a review of their order
* They can go back and edit their order

### Notes

* User can't proceed without selecting number of people or adding any items to their order.
* If user inputs are not valid, show appropriate validation errors.
* Finer details of UX is left for you to decide.

## Submission

* Submit a working link of your code repository (github/ gitlab/ bitbucket, etc...)
* Submit a link of the deployed app (github.io/ now/ surge, etc...)

## FAQs

* Library Usage
  * You are free to use any 3rd party library you want, although we might ask for justification.
